		<para>
			The Name Finder can detect named entities and numbers in text. To be able to
			detect entities the Name Finder needs a model. The model is dependent on the
			language and entity type it was trained for. The OpenNLP projects offers a number
			of pre-trained name finder models which are trained on various freely available corpora.
			They can be downloaded at our model download page. To find names in raw text the text
			must be segmented into tokens and sentences. A detailed description is given in the
			sentence detector and tokenizer tutorial. It is important that the tokenization for
			the training data and the input text is identical.

		<title>Name Finder Tool</title>
		<para>
			The easiest way to try out the Name Finder is the command line tool.
			The tool is only intended for demonstration and testing. Download the
			English
			person model and start the Name Finder Tool with this command:
			<screen>
				<![CDATA[
$ opennlp TokenNameFinder en-ner-person.bin]]>
			 </screen>
			 
			The name finder now reads a tokenized sentence per line from stdin, an empty
			line indicates a document boundary and resets the adaptive feature generators.
			Just copy this text to the terminal:
	
			<screen>
				<![CDATA[
Pierre Vinken , 61 years old , will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29 .
Mr . Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch publishing group .
Rudolph Agnew , 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC , was named
    a director of this British industrial conglomerate .]]>

			 the name finder will now output the text with markup for person names:

		<para>
			To use the Name Finder in a production system it is strongly recommended to embed it
			directly into the application instead of using the command line interface.
			First the name finder model must be loaded into memory from disk or an other source.
			In the sample below it is loaded from disk.
			<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
InputStream modelIn = new FileInputStream("en-ner-person.bin");

try {
  TokenNameFinderModel model = new TokenNameFinderModel(modelIn);
}
catch (IOException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}
finally {
  if (modelIn != null) {
    try {
      modelIn.close();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
    }
  }
}]]>
			 </programlisting>
			 There is a number of reasons why the model loading can fail:
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Issues with the underlying I/O</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The version of the model is not compatible with the OpenNLP version</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The model is loaded into the wrong component,
					for example a tokenizer model is loaded with TokenNameFinderModel class.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The model content is not valid for some other reason</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			After the model is loaded the NameFinderME can be instantiated.
			<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
NameFinderME nameFinder = new NameFinderME(model);]]>
			</programlisting>
			The initialization is now finished and the Name Finder can be used. The NameFinderME
			class is not thread safe, it must only be called from one thread. To use multiple threads
			multiple NameFinderME instances sharing the same model instance can be created.
			The input text should be segmented into documents, sentences and tokens.
			To perform entity detection an application calls the find method for every sentence in the
			document. After every document clearAdaptiveData must be called to clear the adaptive data in
			the feature generators. Not calling clearAdaptiveData can lead to a sharp drop in the detection
			rate after a few documents.
			The following code illustrates that:
			<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
for (String document[][] : documents) {

  for (String[] sentence : document) {
    Span nameSpans[] = nameFinder.find(sentence);
    // do something with the names
  }

  nameFinder.clearAdaptiveData()
}]]>
			 </programlisting>
			 the following snippet shows a call to find
			 <programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
String sentence[] = new String[]{
    "Pierre",
    "Vinken",
    "is",
    "61",
    "years"
    "old",
    "."
    };

Span nameSpans[] = nameFinder.find(sentence);]]>
			</programlisting>
			The nameSpans arrays contains now exactly one Span which marks the name Pierre Vinken. 
			The elements between the begin and end offsets are the name tokens. In this case the begin 
			offset is 0 and the end offset is 2. The Span object also knows the type of the entity.
			In this case it is person (defined by the model). It can be retrieved with a call to Span.getType().
			Additionally to the statistical Name Finder, OpenNLP also offers a dictionary and a regular
			expression name finder implementation.

			The pre-trained models might not be available for a desired language, can not detect
			important entities or the performance is not good enough outside the news domain.
			These are the typical reason to do custom training of the name finder on a new corpus
			or on a corpus which is extended by private training data taken from the data which should be analyzed.

			The data can be converted to the OpenNLP name finder training format. Which is one
            sentence per line. Some other formats are available as well.
			The sentence must be tokenized and contain spans which mark the entities. Documents are separated by
			empty lines which trigger the reset of the adaptive feature generators. A training file can contain
			multiple types. If the training file contains multiple types the created model will also be able to
			detect these multiple types.

			 The training data should contain at least 15000 sentences to create a model which performs well.

			 It is now assumed that the english person name finder model should be trained from a file
			 called en-ner-person.train which is encoded as UTF-8. The following command will train
			 the name finder and write the model to en-ner-person.bin:
			 <screen>
				<![CDATA[
$ opennlp TokenNameFinderTrainer -model en-ner-person.bin -lang en -data en-ner-person.train -encoding UTF-8]]>
			 </screen>
The example above will train models with a pre-defined feature set. It is also possible to use the -resources parameter to generate features based on external knowledge such as those based on word representation (clustering) features. The external resources must all be placed in a resource directory which is then passed as a parameter. If this option is used it is then required to pass, via the -featuregen parameter, a XML custom feature generator which includes some of the clustering features shipped with the TokenNameFinder. Currently three formats of clustering lexicons are accepted:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Space separated two column file specifying the token and the cluster class as generated by toolkits such as <ulink url="https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/">word2vec</ulink>.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Space separated three column file specifying the token, clustering class and weight as such as <ulink url="https://github.com/ninjin/clark_pos_induction">Clark's clusters</ulink>.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Tab separated three column Brown clusters as generated by <ulink  url="https://github.com/percyliang/brown-cluster">
						Liang's toolkit</ulink>.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			 Additionally it is possible to specify the number of iterations,
			 the cutoff and to overwrite all types in the training data with a single type. Finally, the -sequenceCodec parameter allows to specify a BIO (Begin, Inside, Out) or BILOU (Begin, Inside, Last, Out, Unit) encoding to represent the Named Entities. An example of one such command would be as follows:
			 <screen>
			   <![CDATA[
$ opennlp TokenNameFinderTrainer -featuregen brown.xml -sequenceCodec BILOU -resources clusters/ \
-params PerceptronTrainerParams.txt -lang en -model ner-test.bin -data en-train.opennlp -encoding UTF-8]]>
			 </screen>
		</para>
		</section>
		<section id="tools.namefind.training.api">
		<title>Training API</title>
		<para>
			To train the name finder from within an application it is recommended to use the training
			API instead of the command line tool.
			Basically three steps are necessary to train it:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The application must open a sample data stream</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Call the NameFinderME.train method</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Save the TokenNameFinderModel to a file or database</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			The three steps are illustrated by the following sample code:
			<programlisting language="java">
				<![CDATA[
Charset charset = Charset.forName("UTF-8");
ObjectStream<String> lineStream =
		new PlainTextByLineStream(new FileInputStream("en-ner-person.train"), charset);
ObjectStream<NameSample> sampleStream = new NameSampleDataStream(lineStream);

TokenNameFinderModel model;

try {
  model = NameFinderME.train("en", "person", sampleStream, TrainingParameters.defaultParams(),
            TokenNameFinderFactory nameFinderFactory);
}
finally {
  sampleStream.close();
}

try {
  modelOut = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(modelFile));
  model.serialize(modelOut);
} finally {
  if (modelOut != null) 
     modelOut.close();      
}]]>
			 </programlisting>
		</para>
		</section>
		
		<section id="tools.namefind.training.featuregen">
		<title>Custom Feature Generation</title>
			<para>
				OpenNLP defines a default feature generation which is used when no custom feature
				generation is specified. Users which want to experiment with the feature generation
				can provide a custom feature generator. Either via API or via an xml descriptor file.
			</para>
			<section id="tools.namefind.training.featuregen.api">
			<title>Feature Generation defined by API</title>
			<para>
				The custom generator must be used for training
				and for detecting the names. If the feature generation during training time and detection
				time is different the name finder might not be able to detect names.
				The following lines show how to construct a custom feature generator
				<programlisting language="java">
					<![CDATA[
AdaptiveFeatureGenerator featureGenerator = new CachedFeatureGenerator(
         new AdaptiveFeatureGenerator[]{
           new WindowFeatureGenerator(new TokenFeatureGenerator(), 2, 2),
           new WindowFeatureGenerator(new TokenClassFeatureGenerator(true), 2, 2),
           new OutcomePriorFeatureGenerator(),
           new PreviousMapFeatureGenerator(),
           new BigramNameFeatureGenerator(),
           new SentenceFeatureGenerator(true, false),
           new BrownTokenFeatureGenerator(BrownCluster dictResource)
           });]]>
				</programlisting>
				which is similar to the default feature generator but with a BrownTokenFeature added.
				The javadoc of the feature generator classes explain what the individual feature generators do.
				To write a custom feature generator please implement the AdaptiveFeatureGenerator interface or
				if it must not be adaptive extend the FeatureGeneratorAdapter.
				The train method which should be used is defined as
				<programlisting language="java">
					<![CDATA[
public static TokenNameFinderModel train(String languageCode, String type,
          ObjectStream<NameSample> samples, TrainingParameters trainParams,
          TokenNameFinderFactory factory) throws IOException]]>
				</programlisting>
				where the TokenNameFinderFactory allows to specify a custom feature generator.
				To detect names the model which was returned from the train method must be passed to the NameFinderME constructor.
				<programlisting language="java">
					<![CDATA[
new NameFinderME(model);]]>
				 </programlisting>	 
			</para>
			</section>
			<section id="tools.namefind.training.featuregen.xml">
			<title>Feature Generation defined by XML Descriptor</title>
			<para>
			OpenNLP can also use a xml descriptor file to configure the feature generation. The
            descriptor
			file is stored inside the model after training and the feature generators are configured
			correctly when the name finder is instantiated.
			
			The following sample shows a xml descriptor which contains the default feature generator plus several types of clustering features:
				<programlisting language="xml">
					<![CDATA[
<generators>
  <cache> 
    <generators>
      <window prevLength = "2" nextLength = "2">          
        <tokenclass/>
      </window>
      <window prevLength = "2" nextLength = "2">                
        <token/>
      </window>
      <definition/>
      <prevmap/>

      <sentence begin="true" end="false"/>
      <window prevLength = "2" nextLength = "2">

      <wordcluster dict="word2vec.cluster" />
      <wordcluster dict="clark.cluster" />
    </generators>
  </cache> 
</generators>]]>
				 </programlisting>
		    The root element must be generators, each sub-element adds a feature generator to the configuration.

<title>Evaluation Test Data</title>
	<section xml:id="opennlp.evaltest.whatisit">
		<title>What is it?</title>
		<para>
			The evaluation test data is the data used in the tests that evaluate functionality and performance of
			OpenNLP.
			These tests ensure reliability and can help identify potential bugs, errors, or performance issues.
		</para>
		<para>
			The evaluation tests leverage the k-fold cross-validation procedure.
			This technique works by dividing the evaluation data into <code>k</code> equally sized parts or folds.
			The algorithm is then trained on <code>k-1</code> of the folds and tested on the remaining fold.
			This process is repeated <code>k</code> times, so that each of the k-folds is used exactly once as the test data,
			and the results of each fold are combined to produce an overall estimate of the algorithm's performance.

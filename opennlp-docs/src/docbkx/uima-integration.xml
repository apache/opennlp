<title>UIMA Integration</title>
<para>
	The UIMA Integration wraps the OpenNLP components in UIMA Analysis Engines which can 
	be used to automatically annotate text and train new OpenNLP models from annotated text.

		<title>Running the pear sample in CVD</title>
		<para>
			The Cas Visual Debugger is shipped as part of the UIMA distribution and is a tool which can run
			the OpenNLP UIMA Annotators and display their analysis results. The source distribution comes with a script
			which can create a sample UIMA application. Which includes the sentence detector, tokenizer,
			pos tagger, chunker and name finders for English. This sample application is packaged in the
			pear format and must be installed with the pear installer before it can be run by CVD.
			Please consult the UIMA documentation for further information about the pear installer.
		</para>
		<para>
			The OpenNLP UIMA pear file must be build manually.
			First download the source distribution, unzip it and go to the apache-opennlp/opennlp folder.
			Type "mvn install" to build everything. Now build the pear file, go to apache-opennlp/opennlp-uima
			and build it as shown below. Note the models will be downloaded
			from the old SourceForge repository and are not licensed under the AL 2.0.

		<para>
			After the pear is installed start the Cas Visual Debugger shipped with the UIMA framework.
			And click on Tools -> Load AE. Then select the opennlp.uima.OpenNlpTextAnalyzer_pear.xml
			file in the file dialog. Now enter some text and start the analysis engine with
			"Run -> Run OpenNLPTextAnalyzer". Afterwards the results will be displayed.
			You should see sentences, tokens, chunks, pos tags and maybe some names. Remember the input text
			must be written in English.

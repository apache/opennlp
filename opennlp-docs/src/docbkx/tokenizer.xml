			The OpenNLP Tokenizers segment an input character sequence into
			tokens. Tokens are usually
			words, punctuation, numbers, etc.

			OpenNLP offers multiple tokenizer implementations:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Whitespace Tokenizer - A whitespace tokenizer, non whitespace
						sequences are identified as tokens</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Simple Tokenizer - A character class tokenizer, sequences of
						the same character class are tokens</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Learnable Tokenizer - A maximum entropy tokenizer, detects
						token boundaries based on probability model</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			Most part-of-speech taggers, parsers and so on, work with text
			tokenized in this manner. It is important to ensure that your
			tokenizer
			produces tokens of the type expected by your later text
			processing
			components.
		</para>

		<para>
			With OpenNLP (as with many systems), tokenization is a two-stage
			process:
			first, sentence boundaries are identified, then tokens within
			each
			sentence are identified.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section id="tools.tokenizer.cmdline">
		<title>Tokenizer Tools</title>
		<para>The easiest way to try out the tokenizers are the command line
			tools. The tools are only intended for demonstration and testing.
		</para>
		<para>There are two tools, one for the Simple Tokenizer and one for
			the learnable tokenizer. A command line tool the for the Whitespace
			Tokenizer does not exist, because the whitespace separated output
			would be identical to the input.</para>
		<para>
			The following command shows how to use the Simple Tokenizer Tool.

			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
$ bin/opennlp SimpleTokenizer
			]]>
		 </programlisting>
			To use the learnable tokenizer download the english token model from
			our website.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
$ bin/opennlp TokenizerME en-token.bin
			]]>
		 </programlisting>
			To test the tokenizer copy the sample from above to the console. The
			whitespace separated tokens will be written written back to the
			console.
		</para>
		<para>
			Usually the input is read from a file and written to a file.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
$ bin/opennlp TokenizerME en-token.bin < article.txt > article-tokenized.txt
			]]>
		 </programlisting>
			It can be done in the same way for the Simple Tokenizer.
		</para>
		<para>
			Since most text comes truly raw and doesn't have sentence boundaries
			and such, its possible to create a pipe which first performs sentence
			boundary detection and tokenization. The following sample illustrates
			that.
			<screen>
			<![CDATA[
$ opennlp SentenceDetector sentdetect.model < article.txt | opennlp TokenizerME tokenize.model | more

Among other winners Wednesday was Nippon Shokubai , which was up 80 at 2,410 .
Marubeni advanced 11 to 890 .
London share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for London 's blue-chip stocks .
...etc...]]>
		 </screen>
			Of course this is all on the command line. Many people use the models
			directly in their Java code by creating SentenceDetector and
			Tokenizer objects and calling their methods as appropriate. The
			following section will explain how the Tokenizers can be used
			directly from java.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="tools.tokenizer.api">
		<title>Tokenizer API</title>
		<para>
			The Tokenizers can be integrated into an application by the defined
			API.
			The shared instance of the WhitespaceTokenizer can be retrieved from a
			static field WhitespaceTokenizer.INSTANCE. The shared instance of the
			SimpleTokenizer can be retrieved in the same way from
			SimpleTokenizer.INSTANCE.
			To instantiate the TokenizerME (the learnable tokenizer) a Token Model
			must be created first. The following code sample shows how a model
			can be loaded.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
InputStream modelIn = new FileInputStream("en-token.bin");

try {
  TokenizerModel model = new TokenizerModel(modelIn);
}
catch (IOException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}
finally {
  if (modelIn != null) {
    try {
      modelIn.close();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
    }
  }
}
			]]>
		 </programlisting>
			After the model is loaded the TokenizerME can be instantiated.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
Tokenizer tokenizer = new TokenizerME(model);]]>
		 </programlisting>
			The tokenizer offers two tokenize methods, both expect an input
			String object which contains the untokenized text. If possible it
			should be a sentence, but depending on the training of the learnable
			tokenizer this is not required. The first returns an array of
			Strings, where each String is one token.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
String tokens[] = tokenizer.tokenize("An input sample sentence.");]]>
		 </programlisting>
			The output will be an array with these tokens.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
"An", "input", "sample", "sentence", "."]]>
		 </programlisting>
			The second method, tokenizePos returns an array of Spans, each Span
			contain the begin and end character offsets of the token in the input
			String.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
Span tokenSpans[] = tokenizer.tokenizePos("An input sample sentence.");]]>		
			</programlisting>
			The tokenSpans array now contain 5 elements. To get the text for one
			span call Span.getCoveredText which takes a span and the input text.

			The TokenizerME is able to output the probabilities for the detected
			tokens. The getTokenProbabilities method must be called directly
			after one of the tokenize methods was called.
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
TokenizerME tokenizer = ...

String tokens[] = tokenizer.tokenize(...);
double tokenProbs[] = tokenizer.getTokenProbabilities();
			]]>		
			</programlisting>
			The tokenProbs array now contains one double value per token, the
			value is between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest possible probability
			and 0 the lowest possible probability.

	<section id="tools.tokenizer.cmdline.training">
		<title>Training Tool</title>
		<para>
			OpenNLP has a command line tool which is used to train the models
			available from the model download page on various corpora. The data
			must be converted to the OpenNLP Tokenizer training format. Which is
			one sentence per line. Tokens are either separater by a whitespace or
			if by a special &lt;SPLIT&gt; tag.
			
			The following sample shows the sample from above in the correct format.

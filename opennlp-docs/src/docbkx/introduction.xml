        <title>Description</title>
        <para>
        The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text.
        It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation,
        part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.
        These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.
        OpenNLP also included maximum entropy and perceptron based machine learning.
        </para>

        <para>
        The goal of the OpenNLP project will be to create a mature toolkit for the abovementioned tasks.
        An additional goal is to provide a large number of pre-built models for a variety of languages, as
        well as the annotated text resources that those models are derived from.
        </para>

    <section id="intro.general.library.structure">
        <title>General Library Structure</title>
        <para>The Apache OpenNLP library contains several components, enabling one to build
            a full natural language processing pipeline. These components
            include: sentence detector, tokenizer,
            name finder, document categorizer, part-of-speech tagger, chunker, parser,
            coreference resolution. Components contain parts which enable one to execute the
            respective natural language processing task, to train a model and often also to evaluate a
            model. Each of these facilities is accessible via its application program
            interface (API). In addition, a command line interface (CLI) is provided for convenience
            of experiments and training.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id="intro.api">
        <title>Application Program Interface (API). Generic Example</title>
        <para>
            OpenNLP components have similar APIs. Normally, to execute a task,
            one should provide a model and an input.
        </para>
        <para>
            A model is usually loaded by providing a FileInputStream with a model to a
            constructor of the model class:
            <programlisting language="java">
                    <![CDATA[
InputStream modelIn = new FileInputStream("lang-model-name.bin");

try {
  SomeModel model = new SomeModel(modelIn);
}
catch (IOException e) {
  //handle the exception
}
finally {
  if (null != modelIn) {
    try {
      modelIn.close();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
    }
  }
}]]>
            </programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
        After the model is loaded the tool itself can be instantiated.
        <programlisting language="java">
                <![CDATA[
ToolName toolName = new ToolName(model);]]>
        </programlisting>
        After the tool is instantiated, the processing task can be executed. The input and the
        output formats are specific to the tool, but often the output is an array of String,
        and the input is a String or an array of String.
        <programlisting language="java">
                <![CDATA[
String output[] = toolName.executeTask("This is a sample text.");]]>
        </programlisting>
        </para>

            <para>
                OpenNLP provides a command line script, serving as a unique entry point to all
                included tools. The script is located in the bin directory of OpenNLP binary
                distribution. Included are versions for Windows: opennlp.bat and Linux or
                compatible systems: opennlp.

        <section id="intro.cli.setup">
            <title>Setting up</title>
            <para>
                OpenNLP script uses JAVA_CMD and JAVA_HOME variables to determine which command to
                use to execute Java virtual machine.
            </para>
            <para>
                OpenNLP script uses OPENNLP_HOME variable to determine the location of the binary
                distribution of OpenNLP. It is recommended to point this variable to the binary
                distribution of current OpenNLP version and update PATH variable to include
                $OPENNLP_HOME/bin or %OPENNLP_HOME%\bin.
            </para>
            <para>
                Such configuration allows calling OpenNLP conveniently. Examples below
                suppose this configuration has been done.

            <para>OpenNLP tools have similar command line structure and options. To discover tool
                options, run it with no parameters:

                <![CDATA[
$ opennlp ToolName]]>
                 </screen>
                The tool will output two blocks of help.
            </para>
            <para>
                The first block describes the general structure of this tool command line:

                The general structure of this tool command line includes the obligatory tool name
                (TokenizerTrainer), the optional format parameters ([.namefinder|.conllx|.pos]),
                the optional parameters ([-abbDict path] ...), and the obligatory parameters
                (-model modelFile ...).
            </para>
            <para>
                The format parameters enable direct processing of non-native data without conversion.
                Each format might have its own parameters, which are displayed if the tool is
                executed without or with help parameter:

            <para>
                Most tools for processing need to be provided at least a model:

                <![CDATA[
$ opennlp ToolName lang-model-name.bin]]>
                 </screen>
                When tool is executed this way, the model is loaded and the tool is waiting for
                the input from standard input. This input is processed and printed to standard
                output.
            </para>
            <para>Alternative, or one should say, most commonly used way is to use console input and
                output redirection options to provide also an input and an output files:
                <screen>
            <![CDATA[

            </para>
            <para>
                Most tools for model training need to be provided first a model name,
                optionally some training options (such as model type, number of iterations),
                and then the data.
            </para>
            <para>
                A model name is just a file name.
            </para>
            <para>
                Training options often include number of iterations, cutoff,
                abbreviations dictionary or something else. Sometimes it is possible to provide these
                options via training options file. In this case these options are ignored and the
                ones from the file are used.
            </para>
            <para>
                For the data one has to specify the location of the data (filename) and often
                language and encoding.
            </para>
            <para>
                A generic example of a command line to launch a tool trainer might be:

            </para>
            <para>Most tools for model evaluation are similar to those for task execution, and
                need to be provided fist a model name, optionally some evaluation options (such
                as whether to print misclassified samples), and then the test data. A generic
                example of a command line to launch an evaluation tool might be:

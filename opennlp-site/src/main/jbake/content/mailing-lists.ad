__Users__: <users@opennlp.apache.org>

This list is the general users mailing list and is for posting most, if not all, relevant questions.
If you are trying to decide which list, opennlp-dev or opennlp-users, post here first.  Someone will
kindly suggest you post to opennlp-dev if it is more appropriate there.

__Dev__: <dev@opennlp.apache.org>

This list is for development discussions, patch suggestions, and current issues posted
to the issue tracker for the project.

__Commits__: 

This list follows changes to the project. This list is _not_ for questions.  This list
is used by svn to post changes to the project.  If you have questions about any
content here, post them to the opennlp-dev list above.

__Issues__:

This list follows changes and posts to JIRA, the projects bug tracking system.  If you have any
issues please post them to the JIRA pages and not to this list.  This list is mainly for developers
to keep track of changes and issues to be resolved; however, any changes should be posted to
the JIRA pages and _not_ _directly_ to this mailing list.

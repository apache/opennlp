The Apache OpenNLP code should follow our code conventions. All code which
is contributed to the project should adhere to these guidelines. 

* Use 2 spaces for indentation. No tabs!
* Place open braces on the same line as the declaration, for example:

[source,java]
----
public class Foo extends Bar {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    try {
      for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(args[i]));
      }		        
    }
    catch(NumberFormatException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
----

* Wrap lines longer than 80 to 100 characters. For wrapped lines use an indent of 4 characters.
* Within a class or interface, definitions should be ordered as follows:
    * Inner classses
    * Class (static) variables
    * Instance variables
    * Constructors
    * Methods

* Do not use package imports (for example import org.apache.opennlp.*)
* For other cases, we try to follow
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html[Java code conventions] as much as possible.

 U . S .  President  Barack Obama  has arrived in  South Korea  , where he is expected to show solidarity with the country ' s president in demanding  North Korea  move toward ending its nuclear weapons programs . 
As he departed  China  for  South Korea   Wednesday  , President  Obama  took another opportunity to urge  North Korea  to reach an agreement on its nuclear weapons . 
"  North Korea  has a choice . 
It can continue down the path of confrontation and provocation that has led to less security , less prosperity and more isolation from the global community , " President  Obama  said . 
" Or it can choose to become a full member of the international community , which will give a better life to its people by living up to international obligations and foregoing nuclear weapons . " 
The president landed at a  U . S .  air base Wednesday evening , and is to hold talks with South Korean President  Lee Myung - bak   Thursday  here in the South Korean capital . 
 South Korea  and the  United States  are trying to coax the North back to six - nation talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons . 
President  Obama  has indicated he will send an envoy to  Pyongyang  before the end of the year for one - on - one discussions , but only in the context of restarting the multinational process .

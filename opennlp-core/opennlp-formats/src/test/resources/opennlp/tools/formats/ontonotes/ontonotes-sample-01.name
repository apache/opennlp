Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> allies are complaining that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is pushing conventionalarms talks too quickly , creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> .
Concerns about the pace of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons , as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> -- also are being registered at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has called for an agreement by next September at the latest .
But some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> defense officials believe the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> will have a much tougher time persuading <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> to keep some short-range nuclear weapons on their soil once <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> armored forces are thinned out .

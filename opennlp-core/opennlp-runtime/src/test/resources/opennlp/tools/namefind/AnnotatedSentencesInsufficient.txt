Last September, I tried to find out the address of an old school friend whom I hadnt't seen for 15 years.
I just knew his name , <START> Alan McKennedy <END> , and I'd heard the rumour that he'd moved to Scotland, the country of his ancestors.
So I called <START> Julie <END> , a friend who's still in contact with him.
She told me that he lived in 23213 Edinburgh, Worcesterstreet 12.
I wrote him a letter right away and he answered soon, sounding very happy and delighted.

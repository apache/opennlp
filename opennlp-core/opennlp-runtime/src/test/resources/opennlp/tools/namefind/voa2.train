The <START:organization> NATO <END> secretary - general says he is confident the <START:location> United States <END> and other <START:organization> NATO <END> allies will send more troops to <START:location> Afghanistan <END> , where insurgent attacks have surged in recent months . 
He spoke at the <START:organization> NATO Parliamentary Assembly <END> Meeting in <START:location> Edinburgh <END> , where <START:location> Britain <END> ' s foreign secretary outlined the strategy his nation would support . 
<START:organization> NATO <END> Secretary - General <START:person> Anders Fogh Rasmussen <END> made clear that despite an intensifying insurgency and uncertainty over whether <START:location> U . S . <END> President <START:person> Barack Obama <END> will send more troops , <START:location> NATO <END> will remain in <START:location> Afghanistan <END> . 
" Do not make any mistake , we will stay in <START:location> Afghanistan <END> as long as it takes to finish our job . 
But that is of course not forever , " he said . 
Mr . <START:person> Rasmussen <END> said he is confident there will soon be substantially more troops and with that , new momentum for the mission . 
" Our mission in <START:location> Afghanistan <END> ends when the Afghans are capable to secure and run their country themselves . 
The way forward is to hand over lead responsibility for security to the Afghan security forces , district by district , province by province , as their own capacity develops , " he said . 
The British prime minister would like some of the handover to begin in <START:date> 2010 <END> . 
He has offered to host a summit in London early next year to discuss how the international community should proceed . 
Speaking to the <START:organization> NATO Parliamentary Assembly <END> , British Foreign Minister <START:person> David Miliband <END> said <START:location> Afghanistan <END> needs to be built from the grass - roots level . 
" A winning political strategy would select and train , empower and equip , mentor and monitor those responsible for governing the provinces and districts of <START:location> Afghanistan <END> , " he said . 
Mr . <START:person> Miliband <END> says local leaders will then be able to distribute money that would create jobs and rebuild <START:location> Afghanistan <END> ' s infrastructure . 
He said because much of the nation is at war , it is inevitable that governments are focusing on troop levels , but he said there needs to be a coordinated effort . 
" Success must be based on aligning our military and civilian resources under a clear political strategy , " said <START:person> Miliband <END>. 
" A strategy that reassures and mobilizes ordinary Afghans to resist the <START:organization> Taliban <END> , that divides the insurgency by reintegrating and reconciling those is search of money , status or power . 
not ideology and that builds a new relationship between <START:location> Afghanistan <END> and its neighbors , " he added . 
<START:location> Britain <END> has promised to send an additional 500 troops to <START:location> Afghanistan <END> , bringing its force total to 9 , 500 , second only to the <START:location> United States <END> . 
But it will do so only if other <START:organization> NATO <END> nations follow suit , the Afghan government pledges to fight corruption , and its forces have adequate equipment . 
Later this week , <START:person> Hamid Karzai <END> will be sworn in to his second term as Afghan president . 
His government is seen as riddled with corruption and his election is considered deeply flawed . 
Mr . <START:person> Karzai <END> pledged his government will spend the next five years fighting corruption . 
<START:location> U . S . <END> President <START:person> Barack Obama <END> is considering sending additional American forces to <START:location> Afghanistan <END> . 
His top general there has reportedly asked for up to 40 , 000 troops .

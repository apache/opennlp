<START:location> U . S . <END> President <START:person> Barack Obama <END> has arrived in <START:location> South Korea <END> , where he is expected to show solidarity with the country ' s president in demanding <START:location> North Korea <END> move toward ending its nuclear weapons programs . 
As he departed <START:location> China <END> for <START:location> South Korea <END> <START:date> Wednesday <END> , President <START:person> Obama <END> took another opportunity to urge <START:location> North Korea <END> to reach an agreement on its nuclear weapons . 
" <START:location> North Korea <END> has a choice . 
It can continue down the path of confrontation and provocation that has led to less security , less prosperity and more isolation from the global community , " President <START:person> Obama <END> said . 
" Or it can choose to become a full member of the international community , which will give a better life to its people by living up to international obligations and foregoing nuclear weapons . " 
The president landed at a <START:location> U . S . <END> air base Wednesday evening , and is to hold talks with South Korean President <START:person> Lee Myung - bak <END> <START:date> Thursday <END> here in the South Korean capital . 
<START:location> South Korea <END> and the <START:location> United States <END> are trying to coax the North back to six - nation talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons . 
President <START:person> Obama <END> has indicated he will send an envoy to <START:location> Pyongyang <END> before the end of the year for one - on - one discussions , but only in the context of restarting the multinational process . 

Apart from the nuclear issue , Mr . <START:person> Obama <END> ' s visit is seen as fairly routine . 
<START:person> Scott Snyder <END> is the director of the <START:organization> Center for U . S . Korea Policy <END> . 
" Frankly , the relationship is in pretty good health right now , so there aren ' t necessarily any real burning issues , " <START:person> Snyder <END> said . 
" They ' ll coordinate on <START:location> North Korea <END> , they ' ll talk about other issues in the alliance . 
President <START:person> Obama <END> will thank <START:location> South Korea <END> for its contributions to <START:location> Afghanistan <END> . " 
The run - up to President <START:person> Obama <END> ' s arrival here in <START:location> Seoul <END> has been relatively free of protests . 
However , a group of North Korean human rights advocates called on Mr . <START:person> Obama <END> <START:date> Wednesday <END> to speak out more forcefully against the North ' s abuses . 
<START:person> Tim Peters <END> , a leader of the demonstration , says Mr . <START:person> Obama <END> has spoken too softly on North Korean human rights while focusing on security and economic matters . 
" Mr . President , your voice is desperately needed ! " <START:person> Peters <END> said . 
Human rights activists want more <START:location> U . S . <END> pressure on <START:location> China <END> to stop sending North Korean refugees home against their will , where they may face severe punishment or execution .

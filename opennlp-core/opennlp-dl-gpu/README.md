# OpenNLP DL (GPU)

This module brings in `onnxruntime_gpu` bindings to the existing `opennlp-dl` module. If you are planning to run with GPU acceleration, please use this BOM.

You can use it in your code by adding the following as a dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.opennlp</groupId>
    <artifactId>opennlp-dl-gpu</artifactId>
    <version>${opennlp.version}</version>
 </dependency>
```

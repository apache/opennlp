/**
 * This is the test class for {@link LemmatizerME}.
 * <p>
 * A proper testing and evaluation of the name finder is only possible with a
 * large corpus which contains a huge amount of test sentences.
 * <p>
 * The scope of this test is to make sure that the name finder code can be
 * executed. This test can not detect mistakes which lead to incorrect feature
 * generation or other mistakes which decrease the tagging performance of the
 * name finder.
 * <p>
 * In this test the {@link LemmatizerME} is trained with a small amount of
 * training sentences and then the computed model is used to predict sentences
 * from the training sentences.

Last September, I tried to find out the address of an old school friend whom I hadnt't seen for 15 years!
True story
Alisa appreciated the hint and enjoyed a delicious traditional meal.

I read your help-wanted ad with great attention
I'm a student of informatics, 6th semester, and I'm very interested in your part-time job offer.
I have a competent knowledge of programming and foreign languages, like French and Italian
I'm looking forward to your reply.

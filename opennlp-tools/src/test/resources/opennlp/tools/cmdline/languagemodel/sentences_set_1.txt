There are different approaches to getting machines to learn
These include using basic decision trees to clustering to layers of artificial neural networks
It depends upon what task you are trying to accomplish and the type and amount of data that you have available
This dynamic sees itself played out in applications as varying as medical diagnostics or self-driving cars
One of the most common mistakes among machine learning beginners is testing training data successfully and having the illusion of success
Domingo and others emphasize the importance of keeping some of the data set separate when testing models
And only using that reserved data to test a chosen model followed by learning on the whole data set
When a learning algorithm is not working often the quicker path to success is to feed the machine more data
The availability of which is by now well-known as a primary driver of progress in machine and deep learning algorithms in recent years
However, this can lead to issues with scalability in which we have more data but time to learn that data remains an issue

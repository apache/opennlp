 * This interface provides a means for iterating over the
 * objects in a stream, it does not implement {@link java.util.Iterator} or
 * {@link Iterable} because:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link java.util.Iterator#next()} and
 * {@link java.util.Iterator#hasNext()} are declared as throwing no checked
 * exceptions. Thus the {@link IOException}s thrown by {@link #read()} would
 * have to be wrapped in {@link RuntimeException}s, and the compiler would be
 * unable to force users of this code to catch such exceptions.</li>
 * <li>Implementing {@link Iterable} would mean either silently calling
 * {@link #reset()} to guarantee that all items were always seen on each
 * iteration, or documenting that the Iterable only iterates over the remaining
 * elements of the ObjectStream. In either case, users not reading the
 * documentation carefully might run into unexpected behavior.</li>
 * </ul>

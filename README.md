Welcome to Apache OpenNLP!
===========

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/apache/opennlp.svg?branch=trunk)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/opennlp)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/apache/opennlp/badge.svg?branch=trunk)](https://coveralls.io/github/apache/opennlp?branch=trunk)
 
The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text.
It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation,
part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.
These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.
OpenNLP also included maximum entropy and perceptron based machine learning.  
      
The goal of the OpenNLP project will be to create a mature toolkit for the abovementioned tasks.
An additional goal is to provide a large number of pre-built models for a variety of languages, as
well as the annotated text resources that those models are derived from.

Documentation for OpenNLP, including JavaDocs, code usage and command line interface are available[here](http://opennlp.apache.org/documentation.html)

####Using OpenNLP as a Library
Running any application that uses OpenNLP will require installing a binary or source version and setting the environment.
To compile from source:
* `mvn -DskipTests clean install`
* To run tests do `mvn test`

To use maven, add the appropriate setting to your pom.xml or build.sbt following the template below.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.opennlp</groupId>
    <artifactId>opennlp-tools</artifactId>
    <version>${opennlp.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
